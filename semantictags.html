       What is Semantic Tags?
       Semantic tags are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and 
       machine-readable way. These tags provide information about the type of content they contain, 
       making it easier for browsers, search engines, and developers to understand the structure
      
       Semantic Tags in HTML5 :
        1. <header>: Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links.
        2. <footer>: Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.
        3. <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.
        4. <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
        5. <nav>: Represents a section of the page intended for navigation links.
        6. <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
        7. <main>: Represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document
        8. <figure>: Represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (<figcaption>).
        9. <figcaption>: Represents a caption or legend for a <figure> element.
        10. <address>: Represents contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
        11. <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.
